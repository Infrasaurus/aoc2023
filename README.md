# Advent of Code 2023 - Powershell Edition

**WARNING** This repo contains full or partial solutions to the Advent of Code, 2023 Edition.  If you want to figure this out for yourself (highly recommended), please check out the [Advent of Code 2023 website](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

A collection of solutions (and attempts) at the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge.  Decided I wanted to give my Powershell skills a test and see how far I've come in my career as an Engineer.  No guarantee I'll solve 'em all, but wanted to give it a fair (and public) attempt.
